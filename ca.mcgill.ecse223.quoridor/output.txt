    Feature: Move Wall
      As a player who grabbed a wall, I wish to move the wall between possible rows and columns of the board 
      so that I could move it to its designated target position. 
      I wish to get feedback from the game if a designated wall position is illegal.

    Feature: Move Wall
      As a player who grabbed a wall, I wish to move the wall between possible rows and columns of the board 
      so that I could move it to its designated target position. 
      I wish to get feedback from the game if a designated wall position is illegal.

    Feature: Move Wall
      As a player who grabbed a wall, I wish to move the wall between possible rows and columns of the board 
      so that I could move it to its designated target position. 
      I wish to get feedback from the game if a designated wall position is illegal.

    Feature: Move Wall
      As a player who grabbed a wall, I wish to move the wall between possible rows and columns of the board 
      so that I could move it to its designated target position. 
      I wish to get feedback from the game if a designated wall position is illegal.
